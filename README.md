# Next + ts + jest/react-testing-library + cypress + postgraphile + docker = project nirvavna... at least for me

My goal is to give myself some boilerplate for when I want to start new project, but I figure "Why not share it?"

So here I am.

I'll personally use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to clone this repo and use it.

TODOs:

- [ ] remove "lightbulb" specific stuff
- [ ] set up more advanced degit usage
- [ ] _maaaybe_ make better initial components and db schema
